            <h1>Shoulder Pain: Causes and Treatment</h1>
            <p>These are just some of the questions that our team of physiotherapists across ReLiva Physiotherapy clinics answers frequently. This is because painful shoulder conditions are a relatively common occurrence nowadays.

A study reports that shoulder pain affects 18-26% of adults at any point in time. Symptoms can be persistent and disabling in terms of an individual’s ability to carry out daily activities both at home and in the workplace. Shoulder pain, therefore has large health care costs and a major impact on the health of affected individuals, including absence from work and disability.

That is why in this post, we have collated answers to questions about common shoulder problems and what can be done to treat them for pain relief.

          Let’s begin by understanding the shoulder. Shoulder joint is the most movable joint in the body. It is also one of the most potentially unstable joints allowing an individual to place the hand in numerous positions. As a result, it is the site of many common problems.</p>

               <h2>1) Shoulder Dislocation</h2>
              <blockquote>
                The shoulder joint is the most frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of dislocated shoulder, either a strong force pulls the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of shoulder socket.
                Shoulder Dislocation commonly occurs when there is a backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. It could be of 2 types:
                When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability.
                A partial dislocation in which the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a called a subluxation

              <h2>2) Rotator Cuff Disease: Tendinitis and Bursitis</h2>
              <blockquote  >
                 Tendinitis and Bursitis  are closely related conditions and may occur alone or in combination.

              <div style={{display:'flex',flexDirection:'row'}}>
                <div><h2>Rotator Cuff Tendinitis:</h2>
                  Tendinitis is inflammation (redness, soreness, and swelling) of a tendon. In tendinitis of the shoulder, the rotator cuff and/or biceps tendon become inflamed, usually as a result of being pinched by surrounding structures. The injury may vary from mild inflammation to involvement of most of the rotator cuff. When the rotator cuff tendon becomes inflamed and thickened, it may get trapped under the acromion. Squeezing of the rotator cuff is called impingement syndrome.

                <h2>Rotator Cuff Bursitis:</h2>
                  Bursitis or inflammation of the bursa sacs that protect the shoulder, may accompany tendinitis and impingement syndrome.

              <h2>3) Torn Rotator Cuff</h2>
              <blockquote>
              Rotator cuff tendons often become inflamed from overuse, aging, or a fall on an outstretched hand or another traumatic cause. Sports or occupations requiring repetitive overhead motion or heavy lifting can also place a significant strain on rotator cuff muscles and tendons. Over time, as a function of aging, tendons become weaker and degenerate. Eventually, this degeneration can lead to complete tears of both muscles and tendons. These tears are surprisingly common.
              In fact, a tear of the rotator cuff is not necessarily an abnormal situation in older individuals if there is no significant pain or disability. Fortunately, these tears do not lead to any pain or disability in most people. However, some individuals can develop very significant pain as a result of these tears and they may require treatment.

              <h2>4) Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis)</h2>
              <blockquote>
              frozen shoulder symptoms
              As the name implies, movement of the shoulder is severely restricted in people with a “frozen shoulder.” This condition, which doctors call adhesive capsulitis, is frequently caused by injury that leads to lack of use due to pain. Rheumatic disease progression and recent shoulder surgery can also cause frozen shoulder. Intermittent periods of use may cause inflammation. Adhesions (abnormal bands of tissue) grow between the joint surfaces, restricting motion. There is also a lack of synovial fluid, which normally lubricates the gap between the arm bone and socket to help the shoulder joint move.

              <b>Interesting Facts about Frozen Shoulder:</b>
              <ul>
                <li>People with diabetes, stroke, lung disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart disease, or those who have been in an accident, are at a higher risk for frozen shoulder</li>
                <li>Frozen shoulder is more common among women than men.
                </li>
                <li>People between the ages of 40 and 70 are most likely to experience it</li>

            <h2> 5)  Shoulder Fracture</h2>
            <blockquote>

            
                  A fracture involves a partial or total crack through a bone. The break in a bone usually occurs as a result of an impact injury, such as a fall or blow to the shoulder. A fracture usually involves the clavicle or the neck (area below the ball) of the humerus or the shaft.

                  How is Shoulder fracture treated?
                  When a fracture occurs, the doctor tries to bring the bones into normal alignment that will promote healing and restore arm movement. If someone’s clavicle is fractured, here is what they should do:

                  <ul>
                    <li>Patient must initially wear a strap and sling around the chest to keep the clavicle in place.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                  After removal of the strap and sling, the doctor will prescribe exercises to strengthen the shoulder and restore movement.
                  </li>
                  <li>Surgery is occasionally needed for certain clavicle fractures.</li>
                  </ul>
                  Fracture of the neck of the humerus is usually treated with a sling or shoulder stabilizer. If the bones are out of position, surgery may be necessary to reset them. Exercises become a major part for restoring shoulder strength and motion along with mobilisations after a certain period

            <h2>6)  Arthritis of the Shoulder</h2>
            <blockquote>
              Arthritis is a degenerative disease caused by either wear and tear of the cartilage (osteoarthritis) or an inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis) of one or more joints (glenohumeral / acromioclavicular). Arthritis not only affects joints, but may also affect supporting structures such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments.

              [ Related Reading :  Arthritis – Do your Joints Pain? ]

              Diagnosis: A doctor may suspect the patient has arthritis when there is both pain and swelling in the joint. The diagnosis may be confirmed by a physical examination and x rays. Blood tests may be helpful for diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis.
              <h2>How is Shoulder Arthritis treated?</h2>
              Treatment of shoulder arthritis depends in part, on the type of arthritis.

              <h2>Osteoarthritis of the shoulder is usually treated with 2 pronged approach:</h2>
              <ol>
                <li>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
                </li><br></br>
                <li>Along with physiotherapy to restore normal functions</li><br></br>
              </ol>
             <h2> Rheumatoid arthritis requires :</h2>
             <ol>
            <li> Physiotherapy as the 1st line of treatment to maintain and regain the muscle strength, joint mobility and</li><br></br>
             <li> Additional medications such as corticosteroids may or may not be given.</li><br></br>
              <li>In case of failure of the non-operative treatment, surgery is opted where surgeon replaces the shoulder joint with an artificial ball for the top of the humerus and a cap (glenoid) for the scapula. Physiotherapy is a MUST post surgery for full recovery.
