                <h1>Knee pain</h1>
                <p>Overview
                    Knee pain is a common complaint that affects people of all ages. Knee pain may be the result of an injury, such as a ruptured ligament or torn cartilage. Medical conditions — including arthritis, gout and infections — also can cause knee pain.

                    Many types of minor knee pain respond well to self-care measures. Physical therapy and knee braces also can help relieve pain. In some cases, however, your knee may require surgical repair.</p>

            <h1>Symptoms</h1>
                The location and severity of knee pain may vary, depending on the cause of the problem. Signs and symptoms that sometimes accompany knee pain include:
                <ul>
                <li>Swelling and stiffness</li><br></br>
                <li>Redness and warmth to the touch</li><br></br>
                <li>Weakness or instability</li><br></br>
                <li>Popping or crunching noises</li><br></br>
                <li>Inability to fully straighten the knee</li><br></br>
                </ul>

           <h1> Prevention</h1>
                <p>Although it's not always possible to prevent knee pain, the following suggestions may help ward off injuries and joint deterioration:
                </p>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Keep extra pounds off.</b> Maintain a healthy weight; it's one of the best things you can do for your knees. Every extra pound puts additional strain on your joints, increasing the risk of injuries and osteoarthritis.
                </li><br></br>
                <li><b>Be in shape to play your sport.</b> To prepare your muscles for the demands of sports participation, take time for conditioning.
                </li><br></br>
                <li> <b>Practice perfectly.</b> Make sure the technique and movement patterns you use in your sports or activity are the best they can be. Lessons from a professional can be very helpful.
                </li><br></br>
                <li><b>Get strong, stay flexible.</b> Weak muscles are a leading cause of knee injuries. You'll benefit from building up your quadriceps and hamstrings, the muscles on the front and back of your thighs that help support your knees. Balance and stability training helps the muscles around your knees work together more effectively.
                And because tight muscles also can contribute to injury, stretching is important. Try to include flexibility exercises in your workouts.
                </li><br></br>
                <li><b>e smart about exercise</b>. If you have osteoarthritis, chronic knee pain or recurring injuries, you may need to change the way you exercise. Consider switching to swimming, water aerobics or other low-impact activities — at least for a few days a week. Sometimes simply limiting high-impact activities will provide relief.
                </li>
                </ul>

            <blockquote>
           <h1> Risk factors</h1>
            A number of factors can increase your risk of having knee problems, including:

           <ul>
            <li><b>Excess weight. </b>Being overweight or obese increases stress on your knee joints, even during ordinary activities such as walking or going up and down stairs. It also puts you at increased risk of osteoarthritis by accelerating the breakdown of joint cartilage.</li><br></br>
            <li><b>Lack of muscle </b>flexibility or strength. A lack of strength and flexibility can increase the risk of knee injuries. Strong muscles help stabilize and protect your joints, and muscle flexibility can help you achieve full range of motion.</li><br></br>
            <li><b>Certain sports </b>or occupations. Some sports put greater stress on your knees than do others. Alpine skiing with its rigid ski boots and potential for falls, basketball's jumps and pivots, and the repeated pounding your knees take when you run or jog all increase your risk of knee injury. Jobs that require repetitive stress on the knees such as construction or farming also can increase your risk.</li><br></br>
            <li><b>Previous injury </b> Having a previous knee injury makes it more likely that you'll injure your knee again.</li><br></br>

           </ul>
